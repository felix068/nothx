 This extension's goal is to improve Twitter/X browsing experience by removing annoying/unwanted tweets from timeline and comments.
 
 At the same time, the idea behind this repository is for it to be a community-maintained list of users that generally make the browsing experience worse for majority of the users.

✅ Hide tweets/comments from users posting unrelated content<br />
⬜ Local custom allowlist<br />
⬜ Local custom blocklist<br />
⬜ Easily report users posting sexual or unrelated content where it doesn't belong<br />
